description: "Creating defenses against network attacks requires real-time monitoring of network-wide
traffic to obtain timely and significant information. To detect anomalous traffic packets headers,
packets aggregate flows, and correlations are analyzed with the aim of distinguishing normal
traffic from abnormal traffic. Goal for this project is to develop an algorithm for detecting ongoing network attack using
entropy as a measure. "
